Project #11 - weather sprint 

Made a weather application based off a figma design by Isaias Gonzalez, with minor design changes due to a lack of completetion and inability to access hourly weather

Person who Peer Reviewed your assignment: Vanessa Acuna - The weather app is functional. I saw that the search of city worked, the add to favorite button worked, the removed from favorite list and go to favorite city button worked as well. This project also showed the current date and accurate time. Good Job!

Peer Review 2: Gavin
The functionality is all there except the local storage which is still pretty good, Looks close to the figma but not fully finished with the layout but still looks good and lastly, could maybe use some math.floor in your code to convert the temp so you always get whole numbers, Aside from that looks good for what you had to work with. Great Job! I Like the layout of all the details being in boxes below the location tab.
