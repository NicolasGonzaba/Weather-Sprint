Project #11 - weather sprint 

Made a weather application based off a figma design by Isaias Gonzalez, with minor design changes due to a lack of completetion and inability to access hourly weather

Person who Peer Reviewed your assignment: Vanessa Acuna - The weather app is functional. I saw that the search of city worked, the add to favorite button worked, the removed from favorite list and go to favorite city button worked as well. This project also showed the current date and accurate time. Good Job!
